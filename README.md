# Hit Desync HUD

Ever swing your sword, hear the hit sound, see the animation…
and the server goes “nah”?

Yeah. This mod tells you when that happens.

## What it does

 - Shows a small HUD warning when your hits aren’t actually being registered server-side
 - Helps spot lag, desync, or just Fabric gaslighting you in PvP
 - Client-side only (servers don’t know, don’t care)

## Why exactly?

Because blaming ping is easier when you have proof.

## HUD Editor

 - Toggle edit mode in-game (you can customize the keybinds)
 - Move the HUD wherever you want
 - Put it somewhere dramatic

## Notes

 - Does not make you better at PvP
 - Does not fix your internet
 - Does tell you that your internet has skill issue
